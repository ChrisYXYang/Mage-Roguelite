# Mage-Roguelite
A game that I made in Unity. It is in-progress but the core mechanics (combat, map generation, enemy behavior, etc.) have all been implemented. I made this before using Github so there aren't many commits.

**Video Demo:** https://youtu.be/QQJF3R8Zqno

**Working Build:** https://github.com/ChrisYXYang/Mage-Roguelite/releases/tag/build

**Instructions**

You will take turns moving and attacking with enemies in each room. After using your attacks, move to start the next turn. Traverse the dungeon and defeat all enemies! 

**Controls**

Arrow Keys - Move Up/Down/Left/Right

Z,X,C - Select/unselect Spell to use to attack

S - Open/Close Spell Inventory

  - Z - Select Spell

  - Use Arrow keys to change spell location in inventory and press Z to move spell there.
