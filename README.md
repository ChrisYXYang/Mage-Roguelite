# Mage-Roguelite
A game that I made in Unity. It is unfinished but the core mechanics (combat, map generation, enemy behavior, etc.) have all been added. I made this before using Github so I'm just putting a copy into Github.

**Working Build:** https://github.com/ChrisYXYang/Mage-Roguelite/releases/tag/build
